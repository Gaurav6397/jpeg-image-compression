# jpeg-image-compression
i have given the requirements in the requirements.txt, the project consist of three files
encoding_image.py : applying DCT to image and performing run length encoding after that.

decoding_image.py : applying the same  in reverse order.

this is lossy compression as while performing Quantization step some data is lossed which cannot be retrived in the reverse step.
